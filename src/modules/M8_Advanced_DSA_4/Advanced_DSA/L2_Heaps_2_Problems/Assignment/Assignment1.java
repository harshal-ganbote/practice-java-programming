   * Problem Description
   * N people having different priorities are standing in a queue.
   * 
   * The queue follows the property that each person is standing at most B places
   * away from its position in the sorted queue.
   * 
   * Your task is to sort the queue in the increasing order of priorities.
   * 
   * NOTE:
   * No two persons can have the same priority.
   * Use the property of the queue to sort the queue with complexity O(N logB).
   * 
   * Problem Constraints
   * 1 <= N <= 100000
   * 0 <= B <= N
